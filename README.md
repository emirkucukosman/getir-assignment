# Getir Frontend Developer Assignment

This repo is created for the Getir's frontend developer assignment.

Backend is a simple [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) deployed at Heroku running [here](https://emir-getir-assignment.herokuapp.com)

Frontend is a React application created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)'s react-ts template and it is deployed at Netlify [here](https://calm-truffle-58e58c.netlify.app/)

Due to my limited time I couldn't provide proper testing and documentation for all of the components but I did my best show the core concepts
